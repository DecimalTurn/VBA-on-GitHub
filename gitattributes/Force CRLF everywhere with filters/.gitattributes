# This .gitattributes file is configured to fight against Git to keep CRLF inside the index. 

# Important: This fie makes use of the a filter named "crlf". This filter users the unix2dos command that is included with Git for Windows (and most Unix distributions).
# To make sure this filter is active, you have 2 options (A or B): 
# A) 
# - Run the following command at the root of your Git repository: git config --add filter.crlf.clean unix2dos
# B) 
# - Run the following command at the root of the Git repository: git config include.path ../.gitconfig
#   (The reason why we need the ".." is to move one folder up because the config file is located in the .git subfolder.)
# - Then make sure that you have a file named .gitconfig in your Git repository like this file: https://github.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub/blob/main/gitattributes/Force%20CRLF%20everywhere%20with%20filters/.gitconfig
