# Why should you include .gitignore and .gitattributes files to your project?

**.gitignore**: This file is there to help Git determine what files it should ignore when committing changes to the project. It will allow you to avoid uploading content that you don't want to.

**.gitattributes**: This file will help you make sure that there won't be errors due to Git aplying conversions of your files.

# .gitignore

A template .gitignore file is provided here:

## Explanations

Luckily for us, the [VBE][VBEDEF] doesn't really create local or temporary files that you don't want to share outside of your computer (unlike for other IDEs like [VScode](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/VisualStudioCode.gitignore)). However, the Office application you are using might create temporary files that remain on the disk as long as the Office document is open to indicate to others that someone is working in the file ([more details](https://superuser.com/questions/405257/what-type-of-file-is-file)).

This is why an exclusion exists for this type of file (starting with ~$):
```
~$*
```

Sometimes, you'll be working from an actual Office document and only want to share the code as `.bas`, `.frm` and `.frx` files (not the office document itself). In that case, feel free to add extensions for Office documents extensions to your .gitignore file. Some of them are already in the template .gitignore file as commented-out lines. Just remove the "#" at the start of the line to add them back as needed.

### Weird brackets?
You'll notice that the .gitignore (and .gitattributes) files make use of this syntax with brackets to specify file paths:
eg.
```ignore
*.[xX][lL][aA]
```

This is because git configurations are case-sensitive: if we don't want to use 2 lines for each file extension (uppercase and lowercase version), we need to take advantage of the [glob pattern syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)#Syntax) to combine lowercase and uppercase letters into pairs contained in those brackets. It's a bit harder to read, but I'm sure you'll get used to it. 

# .gitattributes

A template .gitattributes file is provided here: 

ðŸ“– https://github.com/DecimalTurn/VBA-on-GitHub/blob/main/gitattributes/CRLF%20everywhere/.gitattributes

This template will make sure that Git doesn't touch your VBA code files. It won't perform any line endings or text encoding conversions.

## Explanations

If you need a refresher or you've never had to think about how line endings work, I'd suggest having a look at the introduction of [this article](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/carriage-returns-and-line-feeds-will-ultimately-bite-you-some-git-tips) by Scott Hanselman. It will explain the origin of this CRLF vs LF issue.

Now, you'll first notice the use of `* text=auto eol=lf` in the template. The first part (`* text=auto`) is to let Git decide automatically for all files (`*`) if the `text` attribute should be "set" (aka. true) or "unset" (aka. false). Having the `text` attribute set "enables end-of-line conversion: When a matching file is added to the index, the file's line endings are normalized to LF in the index." <sup>1</sup>. Usually, Git is pretty good at determining if a file is a text or binary file, but it's important to place the `* text=auto` line at the top, so that the lines that come after can override this behavior when we need it to<sup>2</sup>.

The second part (`eol=lf`) tells Git to perform line conversion to LF during on checkout. Since LF is usually recognized as the default now, this is a good practice. The remaining lines in the .gitattributes file are then there to deal with the exceptions to this rule.

### Why prevent LF normalization for VBA code?

The VBE's heyday was in the 90s. Back then, Windows was running on CRLF and there was no intentions of supporting that competing LF standard. Windows has now moved on and even Notepad now supports LF, but the VBE has not sadly. This means that the VBE expects files to use CRLF and if you try to import a VBA code file with LF, you'll experience weird bugs such as the one described [here](https://github.com/VBA-tools/VBA-Dictionary/issues/38). For that reason, the recommended template .gitattributes file in this repo prevents Git from performing LF normalization on files using CRLF (that you've likely exported from the VBE).

### Does the use of `-text` affect how Git performs diffs?

The short answer is no, this won't affect how Git performs diffs, the text attribute is only there to determine if Git will perform line endings conversion, the diff attribute is there to determine how diffs are performed. Note that setting the `binary` atribute is equivalent to doing `-text -diff` (it is a [macro attribute](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_using_macro_attributes)).

## Should you specify the `working-tree-encoding` attribute?

Probably no, unless you have code comment in a language other than English. You should never have non-ASCII characters in code that is shared outside your computer because those characters will appear differently on someone with a machine using a different encoding due to language configurations. Note that non-ASCII characters won't appear correctly one other people's machine using a different encoding either, but at least it won't change the behavior of the program. The only benefit of using `working-tree-encoding` is that you'll have a better experience using certain GitHub features, since GitHub has some issues when dealing with non-UTF8 encoding ([example](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/77064)).

If you still want to specify the encoding, then it would look like this:
`*.bas [...] working-tree-encoding=CP1252`

In this case, I'm using CP1252 which is the usual Windows code page for Windows OS in North American and Western Europe, but it might differ on your system. To get the number that goes after "cp" on your local machine, you can run the following Powershell command :
```
Get-WinSystemLocale | Select-Object @{ n='ANSI Code Page';   e={ $_.TextInfo.AnsiCodePage } }
```

## Should you specify the `linguist-language` attribute?

Regarding the attribute `linguist-language=vba`, I choose not to include it in the suggested template because I believe that GitHub's system to detect if a file is VBA or not is decent and if your files aren't detected as VBA, it might be telling you something about your code.
  - Make sure that your files include the VBE's metadata such as the `Attribute VB_Name = "..."`
  - Use the right file extensions
  - If you `.bas` files doesn't contain any VBA specific syntax, maybe it's OK if is classified as VB6 instead.

# Should you include a .editorconfig file in your repo?

The `.editorconfig` file is used by many popular IDE and text editor to specify the default behavior when dealing with certain text files. If you want to make it easier for people to use other editors than the VBE, you can always include that file in your project.

# .editorconfig
